If you don't receive an email confirmation, please check your spam folder. 3) You can retrieve and verify your reservation on the My Trips page of the booking tool at any time. </p><p><b>Q: How do I make a reservation on behalf of someone else? </b></p><p><b>A:</b> Making a reservation for someone else is as simple as making a reservation for yourself. In the process of booking, when you get to the "Traveler Information" section, enter the name and information of the person who will be staying at the hotel. </p><p><b>Q: Can I bring a pet to the hotel?</b></p><p><b>A:</b> Pet policies vary per hotel and are subject to the terms and conditions of the reservation. To view hotels that are only pet friendly, use the 'Amenities' filter on the left hand side and click 'Pet Friendly'. If a hotel is pet friendly, when selecting a room, pet friendly rooms should be labeled as such. </p><p><b>Q: How can I find a specific hotel? </b></p><p><b>A:</b> To find a specific hotel, click on the sort button located at the top of the webpage and select "Hotel Name" on the Search Results page. Once clicked, a secondary filter line will appear and give you the options to view hotels starting only with a specific letter or to type a specific hotel name or hotel chain into the search bar.</p><p><b>Q: Can I reserve more than one room at a time, or book rooms for a large group? </b></p><p><b>A:</b> You can book up to eight rooms at a time online by selecting the appropriate number of rooms in the 'Rooms' drop down list located on the first three pages of the booking system. To book rooms for a group, you may reserve the reservations in your own name and then have each individual guest call the hotel or at check-in, provide the front desk clerk with their actual guest information.</p><p><b>Q: How can I search for specific amenities at a hotel? </b></p><p><b>A:</b> To search for specific amenities, you can use the 'Amenities' filter on the left hand side of the Search Results page. Simply click as many amenities as desired, and the results only will show hotels that offer those amenities. Full hotel amenities can be viewed by clicking on the hotel name and scrolling to the bottom of the hotel information page.</p><p><b>EMAIL CONFIRMATIONS</b></p><p><b>Q: What should I do if I didn't receive a confirmation email after making my reservation?</b></p><p><b>A:</b> Confirmations are sent shortly after booking but can sometimes take up to a few hours to be successfully delivered. If you have not received your email confirmation, check your spam folder as your email provider may have filtered the email out as spam. To prevent future problems receiving emails, you can add mytripandmore@travelport.com to your email provider's list of allowed senders. You may also verify your reservations online on the My Trips page. On the My Trips page, you can view your reservation, print your reservation, or re-email the confirmation to yourself. </p><p><b>Q: Why did I receive an e-mail from mytripandmore@travelport.com? </b></p><p><b>A:</b> Email confirmations will come from an email account called <a href="mailto:mytripandmore@travelport.com">mytripandmore@travelport.com</a>. Rest assured, Travelport is associated with our Washington Times booking system and is a part of the booking process.</p><p><b>ARRIVING AT HOTEL</b></p><p><b>Q: What will I need to bring to the hotel to check-in?</b></p><p><b>A:</b> You will need 1) a driver's license or government-issued ID card, 2) a credit or debit card in-case of incidental expenses incurred during the stay, 3) it is highly recommended (but not required) that you bring a printed copy of your reservation confirmation to check-in.</p><p><b>Q: What time is hotel check-in and check-out?</b></p><p><b>A:</b> Check-in and check-out times differ for each hotel. The specific time for check-in and check-out for each hotel is listed on the hotel's policies page, found on the final page of booking. Generally speaking, most hotels have check-in times around 4:00 PM and hold your reservation until midnight. If you will be arriving after midnight, it is important to notify the hotel to ensure they know to hold your reservation for a later time. Generally speaking, check-out time is usually any time prior to 11:00 AM. Early check-in times and late check-out times can be requested with the hotel specifically and are left to the discretion of the hotel once verifying room availability. Because specific check-in and check-out times and policies vary per hotel, please check the hotel's individual policies. </p><p><b>Q: Are there any charges if I bring extra guests? </b></p><p><b>A:</b> The rate you were quoted is based on the number of guests you entered. Occupancy policies and rates vary per hotel. Each room has a maximum number of people allowed to stay. If more people check-in than originally quoted, the hotel may charge additional guest fees or deny service to the additional people if the number of guests exceeds the maximum occupancy limits set for that room. Should you need to change the number of guests after booking, please call the hotel for assistance. </p><p><b>RESERVATION HELP AND CUSTOMER SERVICE </b></p><p><b>Q: How do I receive help booking my reservation?</b></p><p><b>A:</b> If you need assistance or have questions about making a reservation, our representatives are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to assist you.
